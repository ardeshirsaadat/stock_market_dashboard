Yahoo Finance Data for Python
=============================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mqtran01/python-yahoofinance.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mqtran01/python-yahoofinance)

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/python-yahoofinance/badge/?version=latest)](https://python-yahoofinance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Python module to get data readily available from Yahoo Finance. The data is retrieved directly from the website with no data changes.

**Warning: This package is undergoing development and implementation and interfaces may change drastically without notice.**

**Note: There is no guarantee that the data provided in this library is correct. Use at your own risk.**

Installation
------------

You can install the library using:
``` {.sourceCode .bash}
pip install yahoofinance
```

Note: There are a few packages with a similar name, make sure you type the right package name - **yahoofinance**

Usage
-----

To export the Profile data to CSV, it is simple!

If we are looking to export [Apple's Asset Profile](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/profile) we can do the following:
``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> import yahoofinance as yf
>>> profile = yf.AssetProfile('AAPL')
>>> profile.to_csv('AAPL-profile.csv')
```
You can now find the profile information in a CSV file called `AAPL-profile.csv`.

Next steps include exporting other to a Pandas Dataframe, which would be the main reason why this project exists!

Optional Usage
-------------
We can add in a locale to choose a specific region to query from. For example, from Australia, we can query from the Australian Yahoo Finance website to get *marginally* faster query times. Using the Asset Profile example previously:

``` {.sourceCode .python}
>>> import yahoofinance as yf
>>> profile = yd.AssetProfile('AAPL', locale=Locale.AU)
>>> profile.to_csv('AAPL-profile.csv')
```

Current locales include:
- `Locale.AU` (Australia)
- `Locale.CA` (Canada)
- `Locale.US` (United States)


Example Use Case
----------------

FAQs
----
1. **Why did you make this?** I felt that financial data information is often restricted.

2. **Can you make custom data manipulation filters to make the data more tailored to my use?** I do not intend to. My ethos is to enable financial data users to retrieve the data and use it their own way. I do not want to steal the data provided and make my own flavour.

3. **What happens when their website data changes and/or this project breaks?** Let me know with a feature request and I'll do my best to fix it. Or even better, fork and make a pull request!

4. **I want to contribute to this amazing project!** Fork and make a pull request!

5. **I like you, I want to support you financially.** I don't have a support link yet (because this project just started), but if enough people are interested, I'll set one up someday.
